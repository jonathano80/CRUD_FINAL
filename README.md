# CRUD FINAL PROJECT

My website lets the user insert their favorite Adidas shoe into the database. Then, it collects all of the entries and saves them in a phpmyadmin table.

# Motivation

I have always liked Adidas shoes so I decided to make my website about something that I liked. I also thought that this would let me see what shoes other people like.

# Features

One feature of my website is that the user is able to look up the different tables for each type of shoe style. For example
if someone wanted to see all of the entries for the NMD shoes, they can go to the bottom drop down menu and choose NMD and 
click the button that says find shoe. Then it will bring up a table that shows all of the shoes that are under the style of
NMD.

# How to use?

To use the website, the user would enter the favorite color of shoe, select the style and size, then hit submit shoe. Then, the code will update the table for each shoe for the user to access later.

# Languages Used

I used 4 different types of languages which consisted of html, php, css, and javascript. I used the html to make the website layout and display. I used the php for the actual part of the website to store, delete, and update the info in the tables on phpmyadmin. The css was used to make the website look good, which I used by making the background green and adding a border around my picture. Lastly, for the javascript, I added an alert message that said that the database was loading when the user clicked the button to find the info.
